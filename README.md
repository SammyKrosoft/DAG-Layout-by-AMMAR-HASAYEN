# Usage

- The result is an HTML file saved on the script's directory that you can send on the e-mail address of your choice.

- To update the e-mail address you want to send the report to, either use the -eMailSender, -eMailRecipient, and -eMailServer while launching the script, or hard code the default values of the parameters $eMailSender, $eMailRecipient and $eMailServer on the parameters definition on lines 53, 54, 55 of the script, and then just launch the script without specifying -eMailSender/Recipient/Server parameters:

- Example to launch the script with the default SMTP e-mail values:

```powershell
.\DAGLayout.ps1
```

- Example to launch the script with your own SMTP e-mail valueS:

```powershell
.\DAG_Layout.ps1 -eMailSender "samdrey@canadadrey.ca" -eMailRecipient "samdrey@canadadrey.ca" -eMailServer "E2016-01.canadadrey.ca"
```
